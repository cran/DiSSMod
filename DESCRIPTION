Description: Tools to fit sample selection models in case of discrete response 
  variables, through a parametric formulation which represents a natural 
  extension of the well-known Heckman selection model are provided in the 
  package. The response variable can be of Bernoulli, Poisson or Negative 
  Binomial type. The sample selection mechanism allows to choose among a 
  Normal, Logistic or Gumbel distribution.
